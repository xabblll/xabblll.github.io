## Intro

I needed a SRP for prototypes and personal projects because I wasn't happy with how difficult it was to make changes in URP and HDRP, as well as their performance.

For now I'm not using anything fancy. Basic PBR shading, realtime/mixed/baked lighting with shadows and couple of post effects.


<br>


#### Current set of features

- Modular shader library with ability to easily change light model / look & feel
- Shadowmap support for cascaded Directional, Spot, Point light
- PCF shadowmap sampling
- Baked and mixed light support
- Reflection probes support with box projection and blending
- Depth prepass
- draft SSAO pass (AO used with material indirect light occlusion)
- fast ACES and Uncharted2 tonemapping
- SRP upgraded to support Unity 2023.2 (RenderGraph and more)
- Antialiasing with FXAA or MSAA 
- Indirect shadowing shader trick to fix extra bright metals
- PBR shading based on Unity Standard and Unreal Engine Lit shading models

#### Problems

Even at current stage of development my RP is pretty usable. However I want to make it better before going forward.  

##### Baked Lighting

Since I'm working solo, faster iterations are highly preferred. Baked lightmap provides very good indirect lighting,
especially then combined with realtime shadows and lightprobes. But it's hard to get right and without visual artefacts and heavy tooling.

1. Manually prepare lightmaps UVs for every mesh
   - Unique shells without overlapping
   - All hard angled surface shells are separated and smooth stitched
   - Spacing between shells calculated beforehand with object physical size and lightmap resolution in mind
2. If you want to eliminate artifacts when baking modular scenes, you need to develop special tool for stitching big smooth geometry into one mesh and singular shell
3. LightProbes are hard to place right
4. Indirect bounce light can be incorrect - fix bright surface manually adjusting indirect albedo boost in custom shader?
5. Bake takes time
6. Hard/Impossible to use in dynamic scenes
   - Dynamically loaded elements could be baked separately (write your own system to store/assign Lightmap from prefabs)
   - Dynamically placed scene with LightProbes requires custom solution as well.
   - Fully dynamic environment still impossible
7. Lightmap baking settings are hard to get right
   - Pushoff, baking tags and more
   - Still no tools for custom provided lightmap UV (for whole scene)

###### Reflection probes 

More or less same story with reflection probes. But it's almost nothing to replace with if targeting mobile devices

- Hard to place right
- Rotatable box projecting needed
- Blending distance per axis needed
- Independent blending distance and box projecting settings needed
- Hard to assign anchor overrides, especially if very few probes used, e.g. for mobile projects
- Very common problem with very bright corners and big flat surfaces
- Bake takes time

## Future Plans

#### Realtime GI

I want to research different solutions. SSGI can potentially solve many problems, however I'm thinking about more unique and advance tech.

#### ShadowMaps Optimization

Currently I'm rendering all shadowmaps every frame. It's wasteful, and could be greatly optimized with cached shadowmaps - 
basically shadowmap will not refreshed until light or shadowcaster moved. I'm thinking about DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal way
where static casters are drawn to separate atlas

#### Light Optimization

For now every pixel samples all visible light sources. It's ok for small amount of lights, but can be improved with clustered light via
frustrum tiles or world space grid for more complex scenarios.


#### Occlusion Culling

More research needed. Maybe Unity's implementation of Umbra will be fine for PC. Alternatively something like 
depth reprojection or double-pass occlusion system theoretically will work better.
